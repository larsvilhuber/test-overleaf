The Economic Research Service (ERS), an agency under the U.S. Department of Agriculture for which commuting zones were originally developed, distributes definitions on its website.\footnote{ERS has released commuting zone definitions based on 1980, 1990, and 2000 commuting data. All three definitions are available at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas.aspx.} Commuting Zones are especially relevant for the economic analysis of rural areas, a focus of ERS, because they include all counties, not just urban counties.

As an alternative to metropolitan statistical areas, or Core Based Statistical Areas \citep{OMB2013}, many researchers examining local labor markets use commuting zones, which also combine sets of counties based on commuting flows, because they cover the entire country. However, few researchers are familiar with the methodology used to develop these zones. To that end, this section describes the methodology used by \cite{TS1996} in developing the zones.\footnote{The methodology was originally used in \cite{TK1987}, but the 1996 paper is much more
widely cited, and the zones from that paper are the ones most commonly used. For more background on the development of commuting zones, see \cite{FowlerRhubartJensen2016}.}

We describe two especially important design components: the dissimilarity matrix, which measures how ``far'' nodes are from one another, and the clustering method, which decides how nodes are assigned to groups.

\subsection{Dissimilarity Matrix}

The dissimilarity matrix, $d$, is a representation of the relative distance between all pairs of $N$ counties. TS calculate $d$ (or conversely, the similarity matrix $p$), where an entry $D_{ij}$ is the dissimilarity of county $i$ from county $j$, as below:\footnote{The clustering method used requires a dissimilarity matrix; one is just the complement of the other, by element, so $d_{ij}=(1-p_{ij})$.}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:diss}
d_{ij} = 1- \frac{f_{ij}+f_{ji}}{\min(rlf_{i},rlf_j)}
\end{equation}

In the above equation, $f_{ij}$ is the flow of commuters who live in county $i$ and work in county $j$ and $f_{ji}$ is the opposite flow. The resident labor force in county $i$ is $rlf_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{ij}$ (including $f_{ii}$), with a corresponding calculation for county $j$. Normalizing flows with the minimum resident labor force of a pair upweights the association of outlying areas with metropolitan cores. Note that disimilarity is symmetric, so $d_{ij}=d_{ji}$.

TS1996 compute $d$ using flows from the 1990 Journey-to-Work data, which tabulates the commuting information from the 1990 Census Long-form \citep{Census1990jtw}.\footnote{Journey to Work data on county to county commuting flows are available for the 1990 Census, the 2000 Census, and 5-year samples of the American Community Survey at \url{https://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/data/commutingflows.html}.} The Census Bureau estimates county-to-county flows among 3,141 county equivalents for persons age 16 and older who reported being employed in the week prior to April 1, 1990.\footnote{Employment status is based on responses to the question ``Did this person work at any time LAST WEEK?'' Place of work is geocoded using the response to ``At what location did this person work LAST WEEK?'' Residence location is compiled from the mailing frame of the Census.} The Economic Research Service maintains the 1990 commuting zones.%

\subsection{Clustering Method}

After constructing this dissimilarity matrix, TS use it as an input into their clustering method. In general, data scientists use clustering methods to assign interrelated items, or items with similar features, into groups. In their application, TS use the average-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm (PROC CLUSTER in SAS software).\footnote{The hierarchical clustering for this paper using PROC CLUSTER was generated using SAS software, Version 9.2 of the SAS System for Unix.

The hierarchical clustering method uses the dissimilarity matrix in the following way. To begin, every county is its own cluster. Then, it finds the lowest value $d_{ij}$ in the dissimilarity matrix, and combines those two counties together. It then recalculates a dissimilarity value between the new cluster and all other clusters. At the cluster level, the dissimilarity for a pair of clusters, $C_K$ and $C_L$, is calculated as the average of dissimilarity among all pairs of counties between the clusters, written:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:diss_cluster}
D_{KL} = \frac{1}{N_K N_L} \sum_{i \in C_K} \sum_{j \in C_L} d_{ij},
\end{equation}
%notation now mostly matches SAS website, with capitals for clusters and lower case for nodes: https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_cluster_sect012.htm

where and $d_{ij}$ is calculated as in Equation \ref{eqn:diss} and $N_K$ and $N_L$ are the count of nodes, or counties in this case, in each cluster. The process continues joining clusters (including singletons with only one county) with the lowest dissimilarity, $D_{KL}$ until all nodes are clustered. The designer may set a stopping threshold by choosing a maximum ``cutoff'' height, $H$, such that if $D_{KL}>H$, then $K$ and $L$ do not merge. TS1990 uses clusters with distances up to $0.98$.

We illustrate this process in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:caliclusters}, which, displaying only California, shows the hierarchical progression of how counties are clustered together. In the top left-hand corner, only a few counties have joined at a height of $H=0.80$. As we increase the height to 0.88 and to 0.96, more counties are joined together. Finally, at a height of 1, almost all the counties have merged together, forming one large cluster and a few much smaller clusters.

\subsection{Our Replication}
\FloatBarrier

In order to replicate the clustering result in TS, which we refer to as TS1990, we use the 1990 Census JTW data and the methodology described above, with one important exception. Because of computing power constraints in 1996, TS divided the country into six overlapping regions and performed the clustering algorithm on each region separately, and then manually resolved conflicts in overlapping regions. This decision has two consequences for users: first, while the height cutoffs across regions are the same, a step in the algorithm that normalizes distances to unit mean will operate differently across regions. Second, it induces some undocumented subjectivity, since conflicts in cluster assignment for counties in the overlapping regions are inevitable.

Rather than follow their methodology of dividing the country into regions, which required a subjective expert review, we run the hierarchical clustering algorithm on the entire country. We choose a height cutoff, 0.9385 (compared to 0.98), that most closely replicates their original zones in terms of size distribution, though it results in 755 zones (compared to 741). We find that the clustering algorithm, when attempting to produce the same cluster count as TS1990 with a national run, retains a residual cluster that spreads across many states. Only with the lower cluster height, and more clusters, does the residual cluster break up. We leave evaluation of alternate clustering methods for future work, with the emphasis in the present analysis on the sensitivity of estimates to zone definitions. We also note that this residual cluster is a feature of the hierarchical procedure, which chooses things which are locally optimal, but can diverge from global optimum rather starkly.\footnote{We show an example of such a map, using a cutoff of 0.945, in Figure \ref{fig:highcutoff} in the Appendix.}

TS1990's zones and our replication are in Figure \ref{fig:czreplication}, and our summary statistics comparing the zones are in Table \ref{tab:replication}. As would be expected given the difference in cluster count, the allocation of counties to clusters varies across the definitions. Our replication has more evenly sized clusters with fewer clusters made up of a single county. We refer to our replication as FKV1990.
